                </div>
                <p>My name is Josh and I'm a self-taught front-end developer.
                   I'm a fan of anything outdoors, my dog Mako, my cat Pooh-Bear,  my African Cichlids, as well as video games.
                    I'm enthusiastic for front-end frameworks like React and Tailwind. I'm always willing to learn more/refine what I already know,
                     and ready to welcome more skills as they come!</p>
